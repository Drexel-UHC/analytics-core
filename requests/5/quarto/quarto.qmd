# Issue

## Description

**URL: https://github.com/Drexel-UHC/analytics-core/issues/7**

> I'm hoping to make a figure that shows different policy statuses of states (abortion ban, proposed abortion ban, no abortion ban; Paid family leave, no paid family leave; paid family leave preemption, no preemption), with the states in the location of the US map...
>
> I think geofacet mightttt get us close to the figure I'm hoping to make, but not quitee there.

## Example

## Unpacking

Just a brief breakdown of the plot above from the [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphic-many-states-that-restrict-or-ban-abortion-dont-teach-kids-about-sex-and-pregnancy/). There are two layers: 1) rectangles show abortion policy categories 2) triangles show various degrees of coverage within sexual education by topic (contraception in blue vs abstinence in orange). In other words larger/more-orange triangle at bottom indicates more sexual seduction emphasize abstinence and large/more-blue triangle at top indicates more sexual education emphasis on contraception. In terms of data there each state would have three points: abortion policy categories, coverage of contraception, coverage of abstinence.

Lets take a look at the data sent over along with this request.

```{r}
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(geofacet)

## raw data
raw_data = readxl::read_excel(path = "raw-data/family medical leave preemption dataset.xlsx",
                          sheet = 'Sheet2') %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  select(name = 1, family_leave = 2, preemption = 3, abortion_ban_risk = 4)  

## clean state codes
xwalk_states = geofacet::state_ranks %>% 
  select(name, state) %>% 
  distinct()
data = raw_data %>% 
  mutate(name = name %>% recode("Washington DC" = "District of Columbia" )) %>% 
  left_join(xwalk_states)
data

```

Adapting this visualization to the table above would give the following features:

1. The rectangle would be similiar with shade mapping to the abortion ban risk
2. The top blue triangle would map to family leave.
3. The bottom orange triangle would map to preemption family leave. I am assuming preemption is bad?


# Proof of concept

The whole workflow relies on [`geofacet::face_geo()`](https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/). The main function in this package is facet_geo() and its use can be thought of as equivalent to ggplot2â€™s facet_wrap() except for the output it creates. The first step is to create a function that creates the individual state plots.


```{r}
## Set coordinates
container_width_height = 10 # a 10 by 10 coordinate system
rect_width = 6 
rect_height = 3
rect_xmin = 2
rect_xmax = rect_xmin + rect_width
rect_x_mean = mean(c(rect_xmin,rect_xmax))
rect_ymin = 4
rect_ymax = rect_ymin + rect_height 
 
## Append coordinates to data for geom_polygon
data_w_coords = data %>% 
  mutate(top_triangle_x = list(c(rect_xmin,rect_xmax,rect_x_mean)),
         top_triangle_y = list(c(rect_ymax,rect_ymax,rect_ymax+rect_height)),
         bottom_triangle_x = list(c(rect_xmin,rect_xmax,rect_x_mean)),
         bottom_triangle_y = list(c(rect_ymin,rect_ymin,rect_ymin-rect_height))
         ) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(top_triangle_x, top_triangle_y, bottom_triangle_x, bottom_triangle_y))
  

## create a function to make basic shapes
geom_hex_for_alina = function(data){
  data %>% 
  ggplot()  + 
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10),  fill = "white") + # 10 by 10 container
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = rect_xmin, xmax = rect_xmax,ymin =rect_ymin, ymax = rect_ymax),    # add rectangle
            color = "black", fill = "grey") +
  geom_polygon(aes(x=top_triangle_x,y=top_triangle_y), fill = 'blue') + # top triangle
  geom_polygon(aes(x = bottom_triangle_x, y = bottom_triangle_y),  fill = 'red') +   # bottom triangle
  theme_void()
}


## Test function to plot for a single state
data_w_coords %>% 
  filter(name == "Alabama") %>% 
  geom_hex_for_alina()

```


Great now let's us this just append a  [`geofacet::face_geo()`](https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/) to do do the by state faceting; note we are now passing all the states data.


```{r}
data_w_coords %>% 
  geom_hex_for_alina() +
  facet_geo(~ state) 
```


Great I think this approach is getting us to what we want. There are a few things to do to polish it a bit.


- [ ] display triangles based on the data features
- [ ] display abortion ban risk as shade of triangle
- [ ] minimize the inidividual plot margins (to make the layout more similiar to our example)
- [ ] move the 2 letter state abbrv into the rectangle

# Polishing
