# website

For the repository webs tie what pages should we do. There are two main inspirations. 

1. The [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/) which is a great example of documentation
2. The [Faylab Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/) which is a great example of community building.

Thinking about what types of pages we want for our website. 
- **Overview** This is going to be our home page. Post introduction to this repository and different pages avaialble. links to GitHub
- **Welcome** Not sure if this is the right page name perhaps something like the "Get Started" page. This will contain kind the palce we put on-boarding information such as
	- communiting the core philosophies like the Faylab manual
	- how to submit a issue
	- key basic tutorials for skills such as GitHub, Quarto, Tidyverse,  
- **Blog** This is a place were write tutorials or text that describes the issues/solutions frm open sourced problems in the repository issues page. The idea that each issue will need a solution and the output will be a blog post that describe how we unpack the problem at hand and explains our solution. One inspiration for this is the [Appsilon blog ](https://appsilon.com/blog/).
- **Gallery** This section will provide a gallery to the types of final products users we can provide. For example a few sections similiar to the [quarto gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/). The categories could include
	- Interactive documents
	- Visualizations
	-  training (Git/GitHub, Quarto, Shiny, Tidyverse, ggplot)
	- Dashboards
	- Websites
- **Help** similiar to the quarto site help dropdown. This should have at least two items
	- Submit an Issue (which links to the repository form)
	- Discussion section (which links to the repository discussion)
