title: "Datawarehousing with DBT"
subtitle: Notes and resources 
---

This will be a series of 1 hour collaborative coding sessions where we will learn to use DBT to build a data warehouse. This will be extremely informal and will be a safe space to ask questions and learn together. The rough outline of the series is as follows:

- Session 1 (5/10/23): Setup
  - Goal: get softwared installed for everyone
  - Setup 1: Virtual Machine via GitHub Codespaces
  - Setup 2: Local UHC Machine
  - Transition: brain storm on data we want to play with
- Session 2 (5/17/23): Basics of DBT
  - Review key concepts of data pipeline
  - Data models
  - Documentation
- Session 3 (5/24/23): Marts
  - Data modeling and layering
  - Marts
- Session 4 (5/31/23): Advanced DBT
  - Testing
  - Macros
  - Customizing DBT

**Somethings to keep in mind before we start**

- Git is notoriously hard to pick up and also notoriously hard to teach. 

- The learning/teaching process may be difficult so don't feel like you aren't picking things up quickly enough; this is normal. Be patient with yourself and the instructor.

- Learning this workflow is a case of slowing down to really really speed up. Thanks for being here!
