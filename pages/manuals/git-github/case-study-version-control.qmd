## 1.1 Version pit of doom

Does this look familiar?

**You are doing version control!** There is value of tracking changes to a project and having a history of previous versions.

## 1.2 Git + GitHub

Below is an example of a version control solution using Git and GitHub.

![The [**most recent version**](https://github.com/Drexel-UHC/github-demo) can be found at the GitHub repository page. Importantly we also have access to all previous saved versions of this git project, see @fig-2.](/images/github-demo-home.PNG){#fig-1 fig-align="center" width="600"}

![Click the higlighted button to see all saved versions or commits of this git project, see @fig-3 .](/images/github-demo-home-highlight.PNG){#fig-2 fig-align="center" width="600"}

![[This page shows the projects history](https://github.com/Drexel-UHC/github-demo/commits/main). We can see not only what progress occured each individual saved step but also navigate to the state of the project at those individual steps, see @fig-4.](/images/github-demo-history.PNG){#fig-3 fig-align="center" width="600"}

![Click the higlighted button to see the version of the project at the first save point/commit, see @fig-5.](/images/github-demo-history-highlight.PNG){#fig-4 fig-align="center" width="600"}

![[This is the first version of the project](https://github.com/Drexel-UHC/github-demo/tree/f21587aece8a58b3e2ab3b777bbcfe0a4c26a695), as you can see it is empty. However as we shown in @fig-3 we have access to the project state at every save point; this makes it easy to reset to a previous point if anything goes wrong.](/images/github-demo-history-initial.PNG){#fig-5 fig-align="center" width="600"}

## 1.3 Takeaway

:::{.callout-important}
This approach of using a version control system (VCS) [@blischak2016] is an industry and academic  [@Ram2013] best practice. It is much more ergonomic and reliable than manualy tracking versions.
