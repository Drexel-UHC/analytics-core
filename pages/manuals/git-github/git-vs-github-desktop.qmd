Git vs GitHub Desktop
:::


- **Git** @fig-git is a command line interface (CLI) tool which require you to interact by typing commands. It is harder to learn for users without CLI experience and the outputs are not as accessible.
- **GitHub Desktop** @fig-git a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows you to us Git without using the command line. We do Git actions by interacting with a user interface that is designed to be ergonomic and accessible. You can't do all the things you can with CLI but again 80% of features are here!
