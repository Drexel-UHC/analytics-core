**Somethings to keep in mind before we start**

- Git is notoriously hard to pick up and also notoriously hard to teach. 

- The learning/teaching process may be difficult so don't feel like you aren't picking things up quickly enough; this is normal. Be patient with yourself and the instructor.

- Learning this workflow is a case of slowing down to really really speed up. Thanks for being here!
