::: {.callout-note}

This manual was heavily inspired by [chapter 8](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2021-august-remote-computing/keeping-track-of-your-files-with-version-control.html#learning-objectives-1) of Introduction to [Remote Computing](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2021-august-remote-computing/) by Titus Brown's group at UC Davice DataLab. The main difference in this manual is that we try to teach git through a graphical user interface (GitHub Desktop) rather than through using the command line. 

We are very thankful for their open sourcing of their training material and aim to adapt it for a one hour basic version control workshop using git and GitHub.
