    "text": "Goals\nThe overarching goal of Quarto is to build bridges across working groups at Dornsife and the UHC by making the process of collaborating on problems and sharing technical expertise dramatically better. We hope to do this in several dimensions:\n\nA automated way for community members to submit issues/requests\nAn accessible website where we can share solutions. Analytic problems are often not unique and solutions may benefit others.\nProvide training for how to collaborative code.\n\nEverything here is open source software licensed under the MIT license. We believe that analytic problems are not unique and it’s better for everyone if the tools, issues and solutions used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science."

It allows us to authoer documents as plain text mardkwon or Jupyter notebooks and render high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.\nGitHub is a only developer platform which we utilize to open source our codebase, mangage projects, allow issue submissions, have discussions and host our website. The majority of GitHub features are free for academics.\nTidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. We use these packages and other packages within this ecosystem to do solve problems that involve data management, visualization, dashboards and build packages."

If there are no commit changes then the default action is fetch which if click will tell you local repository to compare it self to the remote repository and see if there are any changes that need to be synced. We will talk more about this button later."

This makes complete sense as we have not made any code changes after cloning the remote repository."

Teaching to an audience that doesn’t use command line we will teach using GitHub Desktop (a graphical user interface to do Git).\n\nDisclaimer: There are many ways to use and teach Git and and many Git platforms available. This course not meant to be comprehensive. It is just one person sharing how they learned to use version control.\n\n\n\n\nMost git workshops"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Using a well established Git and Git platform (GitHub) is better than tracking versions/files manually because:\n\nNothing that is committed/saved to version control is ever lost. Its possible to go back in time time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.\nAs we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous version, much like the “undo” feature in an editor.\nWhen several people collaborate in the same project, it’s possible to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone’s changes. The version control system automatically detects potential conflicts between one person’s work and another’s and notifies users.\nGitHub issues/projects/branches provide ergonomic solutions to common project management challenges.\n\nGit/GitHub can help us bring software engineering best practices to public health to enable us to better respond to complex public health problems in a manner that is timely, organized, transparent and reproducible."
