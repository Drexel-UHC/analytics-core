    "text": "Goals\nThe overarching goal of Quarto is to build bridges across working groups at Dornsife and the UHC by making the process of collaborating on problems and sharing technical expertise dramatically better. We hope to do this in several dimensions:\n\nA automated way for community members to submit issues/requests\nAn accessible website where we can share solutions. Analytic problems are often not unique and solutions may benefit others.\nProvide training for how to collaborative code.\n\nEverything here is open source software licensed under the MIT license. We believe that analytic problems are not unique and it’s better for everyone if the tools, issues and solutions used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science."

It allows us to authoer documents as plain text mardkwon or Jupyter notebooks and render high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.\nGitHub is a only developer platform which we utilize to open source our codebase, mangage projects, allow issue submissions, have discussions and host our website. The majority of GitHub features are free for academics.\nTidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. We use these packages and other packages within this ecosystem to do solve problems that involve data management, visualization, dashboards and build packages."

    "text": "Potential Use Cases for Public Health Research at the Drexel UHC\n\n1. Rapid Data Analysis and Interpretation\nPublic health researchers often deal with large datasets that require significant time and effort to analyze. ChatGPT can assist researchers in rapidly interpreting and processing these datasets, providing valuable insights and identifying patterns. By streamlining data analysis, ChatGPT allows researchers to focus more on formulating and implementing data-driven interventions.\n\n\n2. Automated Coding of Qualitative Data\nQualitative data is a vital component of public health research, offering nuanced perspectives on people’s experiences and behaviors. However, coding and analyzing qualitative data can be labor-intensive. ChatGPT can automate the coding process, reducing the time and resources required for this task while maintaining high-quality results. Researchers can leverage ChatGPT’s natural language understanding capabilities to identify themes and patterns in qualitative data quickly and accurately.\n\n\n3. Enhancing Health Communication\nEffective health communication is essential for promoting public health awareness and encouraging positive behavior change. ChatGPT can be used to create tailored, engaging, and easy-to-understand health messages for diverse audiences. By utilizing AI-generated content, public health organizations can improve their outreach efforts and better connect with communities.\n\n\n4. Identifying Emerging Trends and Sentiments\nSocial media platforms and online forums are valuable sources of information on public opinions and concerns related to health. ChatGPT can be employed to analyze and monitor these online spaces, identifying emerging trends, and gauging public sentiment on specific health issues. This information can help public health researchers to understand and address community concerns more effectively.\n\n\n5. Assisting in Grant Proposal Writing\nSecuring funding is an integral aspect of public health research. ChatGPT can support researchers in writing persuasive grant proposals by offering suggestions and improving the overall quality of the text. This assistance can increase researchers’ chances of obtaining the necessary funds for their projects."

    "text": "It is of interest to tell convey stories within data. Academics usually use models to summarize and capture these stories but models and manuscript are not accessible to the public - ultimately limiting the scope of impact our research has to the academic realm.\nHowever there is another way to tell stories within the data which is to utilize interactivity and data visualiations. For example, in the digital journalism field a particular long form visulization medium called scrolly-telling or scollies are used to tell data driven stores in an engaging and accessible way\nThis document will introduce the various three types of scrollies and some examples. Some focus on pay-persons and utilize interactivity/visualization to tell a story within the story. Some focus on researchers and utilize interactivity/visualization to break down model results. Some are more analytics intensive focusing the ability to select parameters and see various outputs."

Below are some useful links:\n\nPackage repository: https://github.com/walkerke/tigris\nBook chapter from Analyzing US Data book: https://walker-data.com/census-r/census-geographic-data-and-applications-in-r.html\nPython version of tigris: https://walker-data.com/pygris/\n\nBelow we will go through how to use the tigris package to get ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) boundaries for Philadelphia County (42101).\n\n\nWorkflow\nWe will be using three packages\n\nlibrary(tigris)    ## to get shape files\nlibrary(leaflet)   ## making maps\nlibrary(sf)        ## spatial wrangling\nlibrary(tidyverse) ## general utilities\n\nLets first get two boundaries: 1) Philadelphia county and 2) All zcta in Philadelphia county.\n\nphiladelphia_county_sf = counties(\"Pennsylvania\", \n                                  cb = TRUE,\n                                  class = \"sf\") %>% \n  filter(NAME == \"Philadelphia\") %>% \n  select(GEOID, NAME, geometry)\n  \nstg_philadelphia_zcta_sf = zctas(filter_by = philadelphia_county_sf ) %>% \n  select(ZCTA5CE20, geometry)\n\nLets map our results to make sure we have the correct things.\n\nleaflet() %>% \n  addTiles() %>%\n  addPolygons(data = stg_philadelphia_zcta_sf,\n              fillOpacity = 0,\n              weight = 1,\n              color = \"blue\",\n              opacity = 1) %>% \n  addPolygons(data = philadelphia_county_sf,\n              fillOpacity = 0,\n              weight = 3,\n              color = 'black',\n              opacity = 1) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe map above shows Philadelphia County boundaries as black bold line. The CTA boundaries are the blue lines. We are almost there, it seems TIGRIS returned any zcta that is even touching Philadelphia county boundaries including zctas that are just on the edge. Lets get rid of those with some basic spatial wrangling below.\n\n## Calculate overlap between each zcta and philadelphia county\nxwalk_overlap = st_intersection(stg_philadelphia_zcta_sf,\n                                philadelphia_county_sf) %>% \n  mutate(area_overlap = st_area(geometry)) %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  select(ZCTA5CE20,area_overlap )\n\n\n## calculate the proportion of each zcta that is in philadelphia\nint_philadelphia_zcta_sf = stg_philadelphia_zcta_sf %>% \n  left_join(xwalk_overlap, by = \"ZCTA5CE20\") %>% \n  mutate(zcta_area = st_area(geometry),\n         overlap = as.numeric(area_overlap/zcta_area)) \n\n## We only want to remove those that have very little overlap. Lets keep anything with \n## greater than 25% overlap\nphiladelphia_zcta_sf = int_philadelphia_zcta_sf %>% \n  filter(overlap > 0.25)\n\nLet check our spatial wrangling worked.\n\nleaflet() %>% \n  addTiles() %>%\n    addPolygons(data = philadelphia_county_sf,\n              fillOpacity = 0,\n              weight = 5,\n              color = 'black',\n              opacity = 0.4) %>% \naddPolygons(data = philadelphia_zcta_sf,\n              fillOpacity = 0,\n              weight = 1,\n              color = \"blue\",\n              opacity = 1) \n\n\n\n\n\nLooks great!

Its possible to go back in time time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.\nAs we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous version, much like the “undo” feature in an editor.\nWhen several people collaborate in the same project, it’s possible to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone’s changes. The version control system automatically detects potential conflicts between one person’s work and another’s and notifies users.\nGitHub issues/projects/branches provide ergonomic solutions to common project management challenges.\n\nGit/GitHub can help us bring software engineering best practices to public health to enable us to better respond to complex public health problems in a manner that is timely, organized, transparent and reproducible."
